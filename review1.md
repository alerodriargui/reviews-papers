Title: Human-Centered In-the-Loop Architectures for Brain-Computer Interfaces: A Taxonomy of User Agency in Assistive AI



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reviewer Blind Comments to Author:



Aspects to consider

What is the paper about? What did you understand?

The paper presents a review of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) applied to Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs), proposing a taxonomy that distinguishes Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) and AI-in-the-Loop (AI2L) architectures in assistive technologies. It analyses ten case studies and classifies them into four functional categories: low-bandwidth amplification, adaptive control, strategic augmentation, and safety/low cognitive burden. The authors argue that different “in-the-loop” configurations influence user agency, autonomy, and system objectives.



What do you think about the paper in general? Justify

Overall, the paper is well-motivated, relevant, and clearly positioned within the context of Human-Centered AI and assistive BCIs. The taxonomy contributes conceptual clarity, and the review consolidates scattered ideas into a structured framework. The narrative is coherent, and the paper demonstrates good familiarity with the literature. However, some sections would benefit from deeper methodological transparency, more explicit criteria for study selection, and clearer boundaries between HITL and AI2L definitions, which sometimes overlap conceptually.



List. What would you change/correct? Justify

1. Clarify the selection methodology of the ten studies. The review lacks explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria. Adding a short subsection explaining how the studies were chosen would significantly improve rigor.
   
2. Strengthen the differentiation between HITL and AI2L. While the conceptual distinction is mentioned, at times the narrative suggests they may blur depending on interpretation. A more formal definition or diagram would help.
   
3. Expand the taxonomy table. Table 1 is helpful but too concise. Including examples and typical AI techniques per category would improve usability for readers.
   
4. Provide a stronger discussion of limitations. Limitations of the taxonomy, sample size (10 studies), and generalizability should be briefly addressed.
   
5. Improve connection to practical real-world deployment. The conclusion mentions real-world adoption but does not explicitly link taxonomy categories to deployment challenges (calibration time, hardware constraints, user variability).





List. Minor changes (spelling/math correction/reference errors)

1. Some references appear incomplete or inconsistent in formatting (e.g., missing page numbers, duplicated authors listed multiple times).
   
2. Several sentences are long and could be simplified to improve flow.
   
3. Slight inconsistencies in terminology: occasionally “AI-in-the-loop” is written “AI2L” or “AI-in-the-Loop”; standardize.
   
4. Table 1 formatting could be improved for readability.





Conclusion. Justify your review in one paragraph

The paper provides a valuable conceptual contribution by organizing HITL/AI2L BCI architectures into a user-centered taxonomy that highlights how system design can preserve user autonomy. While the work is primarily conceptual and would benefit from clearer methodological rigor and more explicit definitions, it is well-written, relevant, and timely within assistive AI research. With minor improvements in structure, clarity, and consistency, the paper would make a solid addition to the literature.

Additional remarks for editors only:

Comments that are not sent to the authors but that help the editor to decide. IMPORTANT!

The conceptual taxonomy is interesting and addresses a real gap in the BCI/HCAI literature. The work would benefit from minor clarifications and stronger methodological transparency, but overall it appears suitable for publication after light revisions.
